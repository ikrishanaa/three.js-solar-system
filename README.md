## 📖 Introduction

Welcome, cosmic traveler. This is a 3D interactive simulation of our solar system, beautifully rendered using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).  
Each planet orbits in real-time, with realistic lighting, orbital speeds, and mouse-controlled camera interaction — all running live in your browser.
